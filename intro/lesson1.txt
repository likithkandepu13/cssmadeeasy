The html structure:
-------------------

every html file starts with 
<!DOCTYPE html>
then followed by 

<html>

inside this we have // this is called as nesting 
 <head>
    <title> //used to change the site title 
    </title>
    < 
 </head>
 <body>
 </body> //contains that all visible on the website 

</html>


Display property in CSS:
----------------------
there are about 3 types of elements in the dispkay property
1. Block element: a paragarph is a dfault a Block
2.inline-block element: takes space what it needs
3. inline element: appear in line of text

.video-stats{
            display: inline-block;
        }
  display: block;


The Div Element:
-------------------
the division is just a box, where a specific code is assigned .
it is so usable, can contain any other elements in thatas well as other division
we can use a container to group all.

Nested Layout Techniques :
----------------------------

Vertical layout ___, horizontal layout|||


CSS-GRID :
----------
much better way to use layout.
display: inline-block, is used but there is some problem when there is an allignment
or using the background color.
instead we can use this
here basically we have : display: grid, grid-template-colums: 100px .. no fo columns , 1fr indicates that the rest of the remainig space
next , column-gap : 20px, row-gap:20px. we can get the space between.


Flex-Box:
-----------
As same as the Grid, flex-box is also helpful to create the layouts
but more flexibley 
display: flex,
flex-direction: row;
justify-content : start; or end or center or space-between   to align 

similarly for verrically :
align-items : stretch or start or end or center
