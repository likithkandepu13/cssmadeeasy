CSS Made Easy!

I've noticed that many of my peers at university, as well as friends, are quite adept at implementing HTML basics to build their desired web applications. However, they often struggle with developing user experiences using CSS. Like them, I used to rely on ChatGPT or other external resources to enhance the visual appeal of my projects. But how long can we sustain this approach? What will happen when we join a reputed company where every aspect of web development is crucial? HTML and CSS play a vital role in creating a strong first impression of a website.

To make learning CSS and HTML easier, I have created a GitHub repository filled with commented code to help you learn through practice. I've cloned YouTube, documenting each step of the CSS development process. This way, you can understand the purpose and application of each CSS line. The repository covers a wide range of HTML and CSS concepts, including:

- Display property in CSS
- The Div element
- Nested layout techniques
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Padding and margins

Check out the repository to enhance your CSS skills and make web development easier and more enjoyable!
